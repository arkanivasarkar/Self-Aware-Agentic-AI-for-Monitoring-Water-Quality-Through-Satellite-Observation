# NEMORRA: A Self Aware Agentic AI for Monitoring of Water Quality Through Satellite Observation

This repository contains a prototype for Water Quality Monitoring Through Satellite Images using a Self Aware (Self Learning) Agentic AI. This prototype was developed during [The BeHappyFish Challenge](https://blogs.upm.es/the-be-happy-fish-challenge/).

## Problem Statement
#### Utilize satellite data to design systems that monitor key water quality parameters in real time, ensuring optimal conditions for aquaculture.
<div style="text-align: justify"> This challenge addresses the need for advanced technologies to monitor factors such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, turbidity, and pollutants. Data from satellites like the Sentinel series from the Copernicus program can be processed and analyzed to provide valuable insights for aquaculture farmers. </div>

## Pain Points 
- Targeting lessions accurately is difficult from 2D scans as they lack the 3D perception.
-
